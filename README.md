# Abstract
Ant colonies demonstrate a finely tuned alarm response to potential threats, offering a
uniquely manageable empirical setting for exploring adaptive information diffusion within groups. To
effectively address potential dangers, a social group must swiftly communicate the threat throughout
the collective while conserving energy in the event that the threat is unfounded. Through a combination
of modeling, simulation, and empirical observations of alarm spread and damping patterns, we identified the behavioral rules governing this adaptive response. Experimental trials involving alarmed ant
workers (Pogonomyrmex californicus) released into a tranquil group of nestmates revealed a consistent
pattern of rapid alarm propagation followed by a comparatively extended decay period. Individual
ants exhibiting alarm behavior increased their movement speed, with variations in response to alarm
stimuli, particularly during the peak of the reaction. We investigated whether these observed characteristics alone could account for the swift mobility increase and gradual decay of alarm excitement. Our
self-propelled particle model incorporated a switch-like mechanism for antsâ€™ response to alarm signals
and individual variations in the intensity of speed increase after encountering these signals. This study
aligns with the established hypothesis that individual ants possess cognitive abilities to process and
disseminate information, contributing to collective cognition within the colony (see [1] and references
therein). The elements examined in this research support this hypothesis by reproducing statistical
features of the empirical speed distribution across various parameter values.
